AI Use Log
	•	Tool/model & version:
ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)
	•	What I asked for:
Solutions and explanations for multiple Rosalind Bioinformatics problems (DNA counting, RNA transcription, GC content, dictionaries, string slicing, etc.), including working Python code and expected outputs.
	•	Snippet of prompt(s):
	•	“Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt. Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.”
	•	“Problem 4 @ FA2025 UTA Bioinformatics … Given: A file containing at most 1000 lines. Return: A file containing all the even-numbered lines …”
	•	“Dictionaries Problem 5 … Given: A string s of length at most 10000 letters … Return: The number of occurrences of each word in s.”
	•	What I changed before committing:
	•	Adapted the AI’s sample code to my dataset (pasting DNA/RNA sequences or FASTA files into the script).
	•	Replaced sys.stdin input with data = """...""" blocks for easier use in Google Colab.
	•	Minor formatting adjustments (ensuring output matched Rosalind’s expected format).
	•	How I verified correctness (tests, sample data):
	•	Ran the provided Python code in Google Colab.
	•	Checked outputs against Rosalind’s sample datasets and sample outputs.
	•	For larger inputs, compared AI-generated output with Rosalind’s online grader until accepted.
